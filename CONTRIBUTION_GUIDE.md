# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to our project! To maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure smooth collaboration, please follow these instructions carefully.

## Before Working on an Issue

1. **Open a New Branch for the Issue**
   - Always create a new branch while you are on the `main` branch.
   - Make sure the branch name includes the issue topic and number.
   - **Do NOT** put the issue number at the beginning of the branch name.
   - Example: `feature/issue-123-improve-login`
   NOT:
   - `#34-new-login-button`

## Before Opening a Pull Request (PR) - YOU MUST:

1. **Review the Original Issue**
   - Ensure you have completed all tasks and met all requirements specified in the issue.

2. **Clean Your Code**
   - Remove unnecessary comments and spaces.
   - Ensure logical positioning and proper naming conventions are followed.

3. **Add Tests and Error Handling**
   - Make sure you have added testing for the main features and proper error handling.

4. **Verify Code Stability**
   - Stop the running code and restart to ensure there are no errors and everything runs smoothly.

5. **Sync with Dev Branch**
   - Pull from the `dev` branch.
   - Fix any merge conflicts and commit your fixes.
   - run all the unit tests and make sure all tests pass.

## Opening a Pull Request

- PRs should be opened from your branch to the `dev` branch, **not** the `main` branch.

By following these guidelines, you help ensure that our codebase remains clean, stable, and easy to maintain. Thank you for your cooperation and happy coding!
